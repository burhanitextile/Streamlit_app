Cat vs Dog Image Classification Web App – Streamlit Project
Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning web application built using Streamlit. The app allows users to upload an image, and a pre-trained model classifies it as either a Cat 🐱 or a Dog 🐶.

The model is a Random Forest classifier trained on image features. The web interface is user-friendly and deployed publicly using Streamlit Community Cloud.

Features
Image Uploader: Users can upload .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images

Model Prediction: The app predicts whether the image is a Cat or Dog

nteractive Graphs: Displays model confidence scores with an interactive bar chart using Plotly
